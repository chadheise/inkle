    Spheres, as with networks, are large collections of users who share a similar feature or experience. There are spheres for universities, individual class years, cities, and more. You are free to join as many spheres you would like. To join a sphere, search for a sphere name in the header search box and click the “Join sphere” button on either the sphere card or the sphere’s page. Spheres, as with circles, allow you to filter your search results on the home page and only view the inklings of members within the currently selected sphere. So if you want to see which bars the Notre Dame Seniors are headed to tonight, join the “University of Notre Dame - Class of 2012” sphere and set the “People” filter on the page to that sphere. Spheres are powerful because they allow you to see collective stats of where people are going even if you are not following them directly.
