    Networks are large collections of users who share an experience or are connected in some way. There are networks for universities, individual class years, cities, and more. You are free to join as many networks as you like. To join a network, search for a network name in the header search box and click the “Join network” button on either the network's card or the network’s page. Networks, as with blots, allow you to filter your search results on the home page and view only the inklings of members within the currently selected network. So if you want to see which bars the Notre Dame Seniors are headed to tonight, join the “University of Notre Dame - Class of 2012” network and set the “People” filter on the home page to that network. Networks are powerful because they allow you to see collective stats of where people are going even if you are not following them directly.
