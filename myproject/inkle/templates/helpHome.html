    The home page is where you can see where everyone is going out (others’ inklings) and let everyone know where you will be (my inklings). By default, the selected date is set to today, but you can see the inklings from any date in the past or future by clicking on dates in the calendar. You can filter which inklings you want to see on the “Others’” tab by using the “People” and “Inkling” dropdown menus. The “People” dropdown allows you filter the followers whose inklings you want to view. You can choose to look at "all blots", which includes everyone you are following or any one of your blots or networks. The “Inkling” dropdown allows you to filter based on the type of inkling. Choose dinner, pregame, or main event to see where people will be at different parts of the evening. </p>

    Whatever your filter values are, you will be presented with a board full of locations where people are going. The number in the ink blot is the number of people who are going to that location that meet the criteria set using the dropdowns and calendar. You can click on the location name to get more information about the location and see who among the people you are following is going there.

    Inkle makes it easy to tell your friends your plans for the night. Simply click on the “Mine” subheader, select the date, and start typing a location in one of the three inkling boxes. You will be given suggestions of locations around you. To set an inkling, use the mouse or keyboard to click on one of the suggestions. Once your inkling is set, you will be able to invite your followers to the same inkling. Simply type the names of your followers to invite them or type the name of one of your blots to invite an entire group of people. Click “Invite” and a message will be sent to people suggesting they join you.</p>

     To clear an inkling, simply delete the text in the inkling’s textbox. In addition to creating inklings to public places, you can also create an inkling to your own house or apartment by typing your own name and choosing your "place" from the suggestions. You can then invite people to your place by sending them an invite just as you would for any other location. You will only be able to inkle to someone's place if they have invited you.
