    The home page is where you can see where everyone is going out (others’ inklings) and let everyone know where you are too (my inklings). The default selected date is the current day, but you can see the inklings from any date in the past or future by clicking on the calendar. You can filter which inklings you want to see on the “Others’” tab by using the “People” and “Inkling” dropdowns. The “People” dropdown allows you filter the followers whose inklings you want to view. You can choose to look at all of your circles (the default) or any of your individual circles or spheres. The “Inkling” dropdown allows you to filter based on the inkling category. You can choose among the three inkling types: dinner, pregame, and main event. Whatever your filter values are, you will be presented with a board full of locations where you followings are going. The number in the ink blot is the number of filtered people who are going to that location. You can click on the location name to get more information about who the location and see who exactly is going there.

    Inkle makes it easy to tell your friends your plans for the night. Simply click on the “Mine” subheader, select the date, and start typing in one of the three inklings. You will be given suggestions of locations around you. To set an inkling, either use the mouse or keyboard to click on one of the suggestions. Once your inkling is set, you will be able to invite your followers to the same inkling. Simply type either than names of your followers or your circles in the box below the inkling and click “Invite.” To clear you inkling, simply delete the text in the inkling’s textbox.
