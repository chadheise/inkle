    Inklings are the means by which you and others share where you are going. There are three types of inklings: dinner, pregame, and main event. If you have an inkling of where you want to go on a given night, choose the "Mine" tab on the home page to set your inklings by type. For example, you may go out to a restaurant for dinner, then head to a local bar to "pregame" and have a drink or two before finally heading out to a club for the main event. Simply type the name of the place you are headed in the inkling box and select one of the suggestions. You are are free to set inklings for one, two, or all three of the inkling types for any given night. Inkle is most useful when you can see where your friends will be headed and choose to inkle there yourself. Because of this, it is recommended that you set your inklings as soon as you know where you want to go.

    You can choose who has the ability to see your inklings using the privacy settings on the "Edit profile" page. Click the arrow next to your name in the page header to navigate to this page. By default, only people who are following you can see your inklings. This means that only those who have sent you a request and for which you have accepted the request will be able to see where you are going. If you are a member of a network, your inklings will be included in the numbers on people's home pages when they filter by that network but they will not be able to see your name associated with a particular location. You can change your privacy settings to also allow the people who you are following or everyone on Inkle to see your inklings.
