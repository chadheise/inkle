    Blots allow you to easily group together the people you are following. You can get to your blots by clicking your name in the right-hand side of the header. Your default blot is called “Accepted” and it contains all the people you are following who are not in any of your other blots. Once you move someone to a blot, they are removed from your “Accepted” blot. If you remove someone from all of your other blots, they are automatically placed back in your “Accepted” blot.

    To create a new blot simply click the small blot with the “+” sign and type in a blot name. To rename any blot, other than the “Accepted” blot, double click on it and type in a new name. To delete a blot, click on the blot you wish to delete and then click the “Delete this blot” which appears.

    There are two ways to add people to a blot. The first is to use the “Blot” button on their member card. Click on their “Blot” button and check the blots to which you would like to add the current member. The other way to add people to a blot is to use the “Add people to this blot” search box. Within any blot, other than the “Accepted” blot, type in the person’s name into the search box and use the keyboard or mouse to select their name and add them to the current blot. You are allowed to put the same person in as many blots as you would like.

    Blots are useful when you want to organize the people you are following in to different groups. For example, you can create a blot for people who live in your dorm or for those you go to trivia with or for any other possible grouping. Creating groups makes the home page even more powerful by allowing you to only view the inklings of a certain subset of the people you are following.
