    Blots allow you to easily group together the people you are following. You can get to your blots by clicking your name on the right-hand side of the page header. Your default blot is called “Accepted” and contains all the people you are following who are not in any of your other blots. In order to place someone in one of your blots, you must request to follow them. Once someone accepts your request, they are placed in the "Accepted" blot until you group them in one or more other blots. If you happen to remove someone from all of your blots, they will automatically be placed back in your “Accepted” blot so you do not need to request them again.

    To create a new blot simply click the small blot with the “+” sign and type in a name. To rename any blot, with the exception of the “Accepted” blot, double click on it and type in a new name. To delete a blot, select the blot you wish to delete and then click the “Delete this blot” button which displays above the list of the blot's members. If you delete a blot that still has members in it, the members will automatically be removed from the blot.

    There are two ways to add the people you are following to a blot. The first is to use the “Blot” button on their member card. Click on their “Blot” button and check the blots to which you would like to add the current member. The other way to add people to a blot is to use the “Add people to this blot” search box. After selecting any blot, type in the person’s name into the search box and use the keyboard or mouse to select their name and add them to the current blot. You are allowed to put the same person in as many blots as you would like.

    Blots are useful when you want to organize the people you are following in to different groups. For example, you can create a blot for people who live in your dorm or for those you go to trivia with or for any other possible grouping. Creating blots makes the home page even more powerful by allowing you to view just the inklings of a certain subset of the people you are following.
