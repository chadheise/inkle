    You can request to follow any other user on Inkle, thus allowing you to see their profile information and view their inklings. Following someone on Inkle is a one-way relationship. You can follow someone without them following you back, or vice versa. To request to follow someone, search for their name in the header search box and click the “Request to follow” button on their member card or profile page. They will receive a notification that you have requested to follow them. If they accept your request, you will be following them and they will appear in your "Accepted" blot. Since you are following them, you have the ability see their inklings and group them with other people you follow in your blots.
